Metamorph
=========

Metamorph is an open source library for performing high-level sound
transformations based on a sinusoids plus noise plus transients model.
It is designed to work primarily on monophonic sounds and can be used in
both real-time or non-real-time contexts.

It is written in C++ and can also be built as a Python extension module,
allowing it to be used in conjunction with the wide array of Python tools
for scientific computing such as NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib.

Metamorph is available under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).
